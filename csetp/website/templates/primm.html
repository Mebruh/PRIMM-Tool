            This tool uses the PRIMM teaching methodology to help you build a deep understanding of SQL.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <strong>PRIMM</strong> stands for: Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make.

        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">
            <i class="bi bi-1-circle-fill me-2"></i>Predict and Run
        </h3>
        <p>
            You'll see an SQL statement and need to <strong>predict what it will do</strong> before running it. 
            Choose from multiple-choice options based on what you think the query will return, then click the 
            <strong>RUN</strong> button to execute the query and see the actual results. This helps you develop 
            intuition about how SQL works.
        </p>

    <div class="section-container mb-4">
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">
            <i class="bi bi-2-circle-fill me-2"></i>Investigate
        </h3>
        <p>
            Answer questions about the SQL statement from the Predict and Run section. These questions help you 
            understand the key concepts like why the query works the way it does, what each clause 
            means, and how the database processes the statement. This deepens your comprehension of SQL syntax and logic.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-container mb-4">
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">
            <i class="bi bi-3-circle-fill me-2"></i>Modify
        </h3>
        <p>
            You'll receive a task asking you to find specific information in the database, along with a 
            partially correct SQL statement. Your job is to <strong>modify the query</strong> 
            to make it fully correct and retrieve the requested data. This helps you practice adapting existing 
            SQL code to new requirements.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3">
            <i class="bi bi-4-circle-fill me-2"></i>Make
        </h3>
        <p>
            The final challenge: you'll be given a task and must write your own SQL query from scratch. 
            This is where you apply everything you've learned to create a complete, working query independently. 
            You'll receive helpful hints if your query isn't quite right.
